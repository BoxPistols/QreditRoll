# QreditRoll

Hello website creator! If you are proud of your work, it should carry your name. And the names of everyone else on the team.

Not only that, it should be epic! You deserve it! Your hard work demands it!

Make it epic, use QreditRoll.

## How to run it yourself
Just spin up a simple webserver, like `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`.

Go to http://localhost:8000/test.html.

## How to implement
Include the QreditRoll script at the end of the `body` element of your website.

`<script src="https://qreditroll.com/qredits.js"></script>`

Make sure you have a `humans.txt` file, like explained on http://humanstxt.org/.

QreditRoll will display your `humans.txt` in awesome credit roll fashion, with epic background music.
