# QreditRoll - an epic credit roll for websites

Hello website creator!

Is your work at least as cool as a movie?
Of course it is!

Are you proud of your work?
Of course you are!

Well, your work should carry your name then. You and your team should get your own epic credit roll! You deserve it! Your hard work demands it!

Make it epic, use QreditRoll.

## Can I see a demo?
Yes, you can! Check it out: https://www.qreditroll.com/

## How do I implement this?
Include the QreditRoll script at the end of the `body` element of your website.

`<script src="https://www.qreditroll.com/qreditroll.js"></script>`

Make sure you have a `humans.txt` file, like explained on http://humanstxt.org/.

QreditRoll will display your `humans.txt` in awesome credit roll fashion, with epic background music.

## How do I run this myself?
It's all static files, so just spin up a simple webserver, like `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`, and go to http://localhost:8000/.
